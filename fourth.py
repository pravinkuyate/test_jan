'''nope i am not happy with this model 

its okay if model tell the person has cancer but in actual person dont
have cancer 

but if person have cancer and model telling person 
dont have the cancer that making problem

because accuracy only calculate the true positive approch 
it not care about true negative so 
precision is important here  '''
